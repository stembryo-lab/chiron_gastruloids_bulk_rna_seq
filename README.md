# CHIRON EFFECT GASTRULOIDS BULK RNAseq

This reposiry contains the code related with the bulk RNA-seq analysis of the paper [NAME PAPER](URL).

This is divided in two parts:

 - **Preprocessing and Mapping**: this folder contains the code and steps followed to get from the raw `fastq` files into the bulk count data.
 - **Analysis**: this folder contains the code and steps followed for the analysis of the count data.

Both parts are independent of each other. If interested in the analysis alone without realigning the data, you can start there directly downloading the preprocessed files.
